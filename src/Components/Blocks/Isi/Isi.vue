            <h5>Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions</h5>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of
                drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)
                or the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the
                PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune
                response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing
                immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse
                reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ
                system or tissue, can affect more than one body system
                simultaneously, and can occur at any time after starting
                treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important
                immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include
                all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be
                clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse
                reactions. Early identification and management are essential to
                ensure safe use of antiâ€“PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver
                enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and
                periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected
                immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup
                to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection.
                Institute medical management promptly, including specialty
                consultation as appropriate.
              </li>

              <li>
                Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on
                severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if
                KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer
                systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or
                equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon
                improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper
                and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider
                administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients
                whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid
                therapy.

                Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of
                patients receiving KEYTRUDA, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4
                (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic
                corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients.
                Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3%
                (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who
                were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of

                in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy
                was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent

            <h5>Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma</h5>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                In trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of
                KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted
                in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an
                antiâ€“PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended
                outside of controlled trials.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Embryofetal Toxicity</h5>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm
                when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this
                potential risk. In females of reproductive potential, verify
                pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to
                use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months
                after the last dose.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Adverse Reactions</h5>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                In KEYNOTE-564, when KEYTRUDA was administered as a single agent
                for the adjuvant treatment of renal cell carcinoma, serious
                adverse reactions occurred in 20% of patients receiving
                KEYTRUDA; the serious adverse reactions (&ge;1%) were acute kidney
                injury, adrenal insufficiency, pneumonia, colitis, and diabetic
                ketoacidosis (1% each). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.2%
                including 1 case of pneumonia. Discontinuation of KEYTRUDA due
                to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of 488 patients; the most
                common (&ge;1%) were increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (1.6%), colitis (1%), and
                adrenal insufficiency (1%). The most common adverse reactions
                (&ge;20%) were musculoskeletal pain (41%), fatigue (40%), rash
                (30%), diarrhea (27%), pruritus (23%), and hypothyroidism (21%).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Lactation</h5>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in
                breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during
                treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.
              </li>
            </ul>
